## Description   
Cross-View Geo-Localisation within urban regions is challenging in part due to the lack of geo-spatial structuring within current datasets and techniques. We propose utilising graph representations to model sequences of local observations and the connectivity of the target location. Modelling as a graph enables generating previously unseen sequences by sampling with new parameter configurations. To leverage this newly available information, we propose a GNN-based architecture, producing spatially strong embeddings and improving discriminability over isolated image embeddings.

We release **SpaGBOL**, the first graph-based CVGL dataset, consisting of 10 city centre graph networks across the globe. This densely sampled structured dataset will progress the CVGL field towards real-world viability.

## How to run   
First, install dependencies   
```bash
# clone project   
git clone https://github.com/YourGithubName/deep-learning-project-template

# install project   
cd deep-learning-project-template 
pip install -e .   
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```   
 Next, navigate to any file and run it.   
 ```bash
# module folder
cd project

# run module (example: mnist as your main contribution)   
python lit_classifier_main.py    
```

## Imports
This project is setup as a package which means you can now easily import any file into any other file like so:
```python
from project.datasets.mnist import mnist
from project.lit_classifier_main import LitClassifier
from pytorch_lightning import Trainer

# model
model = LitClassifier()

# data
train, val, test = mnist()

# train
trainer = Trainer()
trainer.fit(model, train, val)

# test using the best model!
trainer.test(test_dataloaders=test)
```
